# No Framework Web App
A web application that doesn't use a JavaScript framework.

## Synopsis
I wanted to get into web application development but didn't want to have to learn both JavaScript _and_ a framework (I.e. node, Angular, etc.).  I sought out information to get me "jump started" and came across the video _JavaScript BookList App | No Frameworks_ from the channel Traversy Media which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/JaMCxVWtW58).

## Running the App
This is a _very_ simple application which you can see in all its glory [here](https://kyleegland.github.io/no_framework_web_app/).

## Misc Notes
I'm doing this as a learning exercise and while I wrote the exact code in the video initially, I will be coming back periodically to make changes as I experiment with both this application and [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
